# Simple Todo Application

## Installation

To install the todo application, you'll need to create a MySQL database and populate the `include/Database.class.php` with the database username and password. You'll need to also run the SQL files located in the `sql` directory (run the `Account.sql` first). 

Once the database is setup, upload the files to your webserver and your application should be good to go!
